hey_
  take_this_xml
  and look_for_these_elements
  let_me_know_if_you_find_any_of_them

its like this ....

HugeXML.read xml, elements_lookup do |element|
  # => element{ :name, :value, :attributes}
end

OR simply

HugeXML.read xml do |element|
# this will catch all opening elements

still you can control this as

HugeXML.read xml, elements_lookup do |element, reader|

Here reader represents (Nokogir)pointer/cursor (but not actually itself is) which keeps on moving as we keep
on reading file stream. and has the following methods for us

element = reader.try_next elements
element = reader.try_next_with_value elements
element = reader.try_next_with_attributes elements

Note* use reader on trial basis :)
